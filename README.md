# Cat image classifier and identifier

### Based on simple logistic regression
- Based on the Sigmoid function to classify images based on Cat/No cat.
- Learning rate kept relatively low - around 2000 iterations seems to do the job.
- Built and tested on 28x28 RGB images.

### Constraints
- Images in training, test and prediction data need to have identical dimensions.
